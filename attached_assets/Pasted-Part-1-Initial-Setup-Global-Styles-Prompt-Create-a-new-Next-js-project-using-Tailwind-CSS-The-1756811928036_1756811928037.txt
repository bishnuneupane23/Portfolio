The H1 heading should be: 'QA Lead @ankaEK | Manual & Automation Testing Enthusiast | Detail-Oriented | Problem Solver'

Part 4: About & Skills Sections
Prompt: "Create two new sections below the hero.
An 'About' section containing this professional summary: 'I'm deeply passionate about building reliable, high-quality software. With hands-on experience in manual testing and a growing skill set in automation, I thrive on uncovering bugs, crafting efficient test cases, and ensuring smooth user experiences. My journey began at Broadway Infosys, where I trained rigorously in QA practices, contributed to real-world projects, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver results. I'm skilled in bug tracking with tools like JIRA, and have led QA efforts during agile sprints—driving quality with strong communication and leadership. Currently, I lead the QA function at ankaEK, where I continue to advocate for excellence in every release. Let's connect if you're passionate about quality, product improvement, or tech-driven teamwork!'
A 'Skills' section that displays a proficiency matrix for the following tools: Taiga (Advanced), Postman (Intermediate), APIDOG (Intermediate), JIRA (Beginner), JMeter (Beginner)."
Part 5: Projects Section
Prompt: "Now, add a 'Projects' section. This section should display a grid of project cards.

The page should have a 'Problem' section with the text: 'unreliable redemption flow; API instability under load; regression escapes.'
Add a 'Goals & Success' section listing: 'Defect leakage ≤10% per release', 'Redemption API p95 ≤ 600ms @ 10,000 CCU', 'Automation pass ≥90% on critical redemption paths', and 'Bug reopen ≤10% per release'.
Now, do the same for a new page /projects/connect-persona. The problem statement is '1-way & 2-way connection via link; Connection & Contact management.' and the goals are 'Defect leakage ≤10% per release' and 'Bug reopen <10% per release'.
Finally, create a page route /projects/lahv-plus-parking that simply says 'Case Study: Coming Soon' with a button to go back to the main projects page."
Part 7: Résumé & Contact Sections
Prompt: "Let's create the final two sections for the main page.
A 'Résumé' section with a clean, ATS-friendly layout.

Add a prominent 'Download Résumé (PDF)' button.
A 'Contact' section. Include the Calendly link, the mailto link, and my phone number +977 980-354-5245. Add a status that says 'Hybrid | Currently working' and the promise 'I reply within 24 hours.'"
Part 8: Footer & SEO
